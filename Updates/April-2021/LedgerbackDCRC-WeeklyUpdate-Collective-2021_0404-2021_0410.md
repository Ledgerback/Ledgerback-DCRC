## Interviews
### Morshed Mannan
Charles had an interview with Morshed Mannan or his research project on the  future governance strategies of early-stage platform cooperatives.

After the interview, Charles asked Morshed for his thoughts on:

1.  What is a  researcch  cooperative conceptually?; and
2.  What does a research cooperative do?

You can find  Morshed's thoguhts [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IbJFnZhaM_S9Wucq_GYkG79FKhZSp15Jf8ZyuPD4APw/edit?usp=sharing).

# Thinking

Some brainstorming questions:

1. Would the democratic management of a recommender system count as  an AI commons?
2. What kind of resource is data?
3. Can we create a webpage for the directory and make it social like the  [Observatory of Public Sector Innovation](https://oecd-opsi.org/toolkit-navigator/)?

# Reading
